# WordPress: Caldera Forms Review for PILnet

This plugin provides a custom Caldera Forms processor with the following functionality:

* All entries are tracked with a review status and related Matter ID, if any.
* Any entry can be reviewed as 'REJECTED', or 'ACCEPTED'. Reviews
* An 'ACCEPTED' review causes the entry to be processed into appropriate CiviCRM
  contacts and Matters.

Controls related to these features appear, for each entry, in the "PILnet Reviews" 
section of the Caldera Forms entry viewer.
